#### Component Structure

```typescript
// Component template
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Icon } from 'lucide-react';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define props with TypeScript
}

const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```
